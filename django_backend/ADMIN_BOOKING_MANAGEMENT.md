  }
}
```

## Features

### **Status Management**
- **Valid Statuses**: `pending`, `confirmed`, `cancelled`, `completed`
- **Status Validation**: Prevents invalid status values
- **Business Rules**: Cannot change status of completed bookings

### **Audit Trail**
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All status changes logged with timestamp and admin user
- **Admin Notes**: Optional notes for status change reasons
- **History Tracking**: Status changes appended to booking notes with full context

### **Notification Integration**
- **Confirmation Notifications**: Ready for integration with SMS/email services
- **Notification Tracking**: Records whether notifications were sent
- **User Communication**: Prepared for automated customer updates

### **Error Handling**
- **404**: Booking not found
- **400**: Invalid status or business rule violations  
- **500**: Server errors with detailed logging

## Business Logic

### **Status Transitions**
```
pending → confirmed (Admin confirms payment/eligibility)
pending → cancelled (Admin rejects booking)
confirmed → completed (Booking finished)
confirmed → cancelled (Emergency cancellation)
completed → completed (Cannot change completed bookings)
```

### **Admin Actions**
1. **Confirm Pending Bookings**: After payment/eligibility verification
2. **Mark as Completed**: When yacht returns and booking finishes
3. **Emergency Cancellation**: Cancel confirmed bookings if needed
4. **Add Admin Notes**: Document reasons for status changes

## Integration Points

### **Notification System**
- Booking confirmations trigger user notifications
- Status changes can trigger automated workflows
- Ready for SMS/email integration via Twilio/SendGrid

### **Payment Integration**
- Confirmed status can trigger payment processing
- Status updates can sync with payment gateway
- Refund processing for cancellations

### **Reporting & Analytics**
- Status change audit trail for reporting
- Admin performance tracking
- Booking conversion metrics

## Usage Examples

### **Confirm Pending Booking**
```bash
POST /bookings/5/status/
{
  "status": "confirmed",
  "admin_notes": "Payment verified via Stripe",
  "admin_user": "Marina Manager"
}
```

### **Mark Booking Completed**
```bash
POST /bookings/5/status/
{
  "status": "completed",
  "admin_notes": "Yacht returned in good condition",
  "admin_user": "Dock Supervisor"
}
```

### **Emergency Cancellation**
```bash
POST /bookings/5/status/
{
  "status": "cancelled",
  "admin_notes": "Weather conditions unsafe",
  "admin_user": "Safety Officer"
}
```

## Security Considerations
- In production, admin_user should be extracted from authenticated session
- Role-based access control should restrict endpoint to admin users only
- API key or JWT authentication recommended for admin endpoints
- Audit logs should be immutable and archived for compliance

## Status
✅ **Admin status management endpoint implemented**
✅ **Comprehensive validation and business rules**
