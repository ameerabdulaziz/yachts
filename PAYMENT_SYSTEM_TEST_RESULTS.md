## Minor Issues Identified

1. **Duplicate PaymentIntent Prevention**: Need to improve uniqueness handling
2. **Date Availability**: Some test dates showing as unavailable (likely due to existing test data)
3. **Error Messages**: Could enhance user-friendly error responses

## Recommendations for Production

1. **Replace Mock Stripe Service**: Install `stripe` Python package and update service
2. **Add Rate Limiting**: Implement request rate limiting for payment endpoints  
3. **Enhanced Logging**: Add structured logging for payment processing
4. **Webhook Security**: Implement Stripe signature verification
5. **Database Indexes**: Add indexes for payment intent and transaction queries
