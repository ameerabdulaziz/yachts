# Ownership and Fuel Wallet Endpoints - Implementation Complete

## Issue Resolved
**Problem**: All ownership and fuel wallet endpoints were returning 404 errors
**Root Cause**: Missing `urls.py` file in ownership app and incorrect field references in views

## Solution Applied

### 1. **Created Missing URL Configuration**
Added `django_backend/ownership/urls.py` with comprehensive endpoint routing:
- Fractional ownership management endpoints
- Fuel wallet management and transaction endpoints
- User-specific data retrieval endpoints

### 2. **Implemented Complete View Functions**
Created `django_backend/ownership/views.py` with full API functionality:
- Fixed model field references (`owner` vs `user`, `current_balance` vs `balance`)
- Implemented proper error handling and validation
- Added comprehensive response formatting

### 3. **Enabled URLs in Main Configuration**
Updated `django_backend/yachtak_api/urls.py` to include ownership URLs:
```python
# Task 4 - Ownership and Fuel Wallet endpoints
path('', include('ownership.urls')),
```
